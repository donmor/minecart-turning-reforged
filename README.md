This is a Forge port of [Minecart Turning](https://github.com/tildejustin/minecart-turning) for Fabric. It fixes [MC-201](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-201) so players rotate with minecarts as well as when on uncontrolled pigs, untamed horses, secondary boat passengers, etc. The mod will also add a keybinding to toggle the mod on and off.

#### Compatibility
This mod is built for 1.20.1, but does support 1.20~1.20.4 (all Minecraft 1.20.x versions using JAVA 17).
